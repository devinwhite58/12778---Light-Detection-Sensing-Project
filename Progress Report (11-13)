Description: For our project we will create a portable light identification device that can identify artificial light sources using a photodiode sensor.

Completed Tasks:
- We have ordered our sensors that we plan to use for the project (see Equipment Requirements page)

Close Future Tasks to Complete:
- Need to formalize our experimental procedure (interface circuit w/ RPi Pico and sensor, python sampling program, shielding techniques, etc.)
- Conduct the experiments to collect bulb response functions (BRFs)
- We need to increase our understanding of the physics behind the bulb response functions and how they change/why they are different between sources (meet with Mark Sheinin)

Further Out Tasks:
- Make the software program that identifies artificial light sources based on output signal
- Make this a portable device
